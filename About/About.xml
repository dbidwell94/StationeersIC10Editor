        - Undo/Redo functionality (also works on accidential import)
        - Common keyboard shortcuts (Ctrl+? for copy/paste/cut/undo/redo)
        - Save and close editor with Ctrl+S
        - Save and close editor + export to IC chip with Ctrl+E
        - Multiline selection
        - Syntax highlighting
        - Tooltips for IC10 instructions
        - Ctrl+click on a name to open Stationpedia
        - Switch to native editor
        - (Currently) no line/size limit (use at your own risk, this might change or break with game updates)

        [b]Installation[/b]
        This is a [b]StationeersLaunchPad[/b] Plugin Mod. It requires BepInEx to be installed.
        See: https://github.com/StationeersLaunchPad/StationeersLaunchPad

        Known issues/pitfalls:

        - Move mouse handling code to HandleInput(), fix selecing last line with mouse

        - Syntax highlighting for labels, aliases and defines (was removed by accident)

        - Handle input only when having focus (Enter/Backspace were triggered when typing in Stationpedia before)

        - Move editor window to the right if another game window opened (to not
          overlap it completely, such that the user at least recognizes where
          the game window (e.g. Stationpedia) is
